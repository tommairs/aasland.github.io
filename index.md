# Its all about me!
**Welcome to the world of Tom Mairs** 

I have a very wide range of interests that don't necessarily go together; a "Jack of all Trades", if you will. There is a nifty infographic here that puts the interesting things all in one place.

I have been working in the Computer/Electronics/Robotics industry(s) for longer than I care to admit, and some of my experience is actually useful.

Most recently, I spent 14 years working in the email industry delivering solutions to customers. You can read my resume here.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
